# Getting in Touch

We believe in being reachable to all who want to have a discussion. So we have come up with a system of representation to ensure that you are provided with the support you need. 

You can always drop a message on the [#appsec](https://equinor.slack.com/archives/CMM6FSW5V) and [#security-campion](https://equinor.slack.com/archives/C036HGPBJ04) slack channels, but we have also assigned you a representative from our team. Find your representative [here](https://statoilsrm.sharepoint.com/sites/securitychampion9) under the 'Appsec Representative' section.

Your appsec representative will also connect with you from time to time to check if you need help with tackling security related challenges.
