# Onboarding for new Security Champions

## Welcome young padawan

Now that you've signed up for Equinor's Security Champion environment, I bet you're wondering what you've gotten your self in to?
If you haven't had a onboarding meeting since you joined, please request one in the Security Champion slack channel! We hope to get everyone automagically invited, but mistakes can happen.

## Expectations

Security is _everyone's_ responsibility! You as a Security Champion are a voice for security. Your role is to bring security on the agenda within your team, helping the "shift left security" mentality.

The Security Champions environment is a community made up of people interested in security where the _people_ are in the center. You and your experiences will drive this community, and we will rely on you to participate in discussions, activities and ask questions. Don't worry, we won't bite!

## What you get

You get to take part in a community of like minded people. There will be activities only catered to Security Champions, which can be used to improve your knowledge regarding security. This will hopefully ignite that security spark within you.
You will help form this community, as your voice and your experiences matter. Last but not least: You can get some awesome merch!

## Merch

- Stickers: A large assortment of stickers to help show that you are the voice of security! With the amount of stickers we have, you will get a proper workout while carrying your laptop?
- Hoodie: You act the part? Great! The only thing lacking is dressing for the part! Contribute in a Security Champion Seminar to get an awesome hoodie!
- Socks: Socks decorated with The Security Champion shields! Would they have protected Achilles? Maybe not. Will they protect you from cyber criminals? Who knows! But you will certainly look stylish while being hacked!
- Book (Alice and Bob Learn Application Security): Complete the challenge at [this form](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/cLRPzRtPGQ)
- AbbSack: You have to see it to believe it! Keep your items _secure_ while traveling.
- Lanyard: Decorate your neck with shields to ward off evil _phishing_ attacks. It even holds your card!
- Pins: Decorate your lanyard or clothes with shields to further increase your _phishing_ protection.
- Christmas ornament: No christmas is secure without your own Security Champion christmas tree ornament.

To get these items, you can find out where the AppSec office is, social engineer your way in to the building, find our seats and ask for one or more of the items.

OR

You can get in touch with the team when we do stands and events.
