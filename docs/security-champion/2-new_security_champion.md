# Onboarding for new Security Champions

## Welcome young padawan

Now that you've signed up for Equinor's Security Champion environment, I bet you're wondering what you've gotten yourself into? If you haven't had an onboarding meeting since you joined, please request one in the Security Champion slack channel! We hope to get everyone automagically invited, but mistakes can happen.

## Expectations

Security is _everyone's_ responsibility! You as a Security Champion are a voice for security. Your role is to bring security on the agenda within your team, helping the "shift left security" mentality.

    Security is _everyone's_ responsibility! You as a Security Champion are a voice for security.

The Security Champions environment is a community made up of people interested in security where the _people_ are in the center. You and your experiences will drive this community, and we will rely on you to participate in discussions, activities and ask questions. Don't worry, we won't bite!

More on the merch you can get from the different belts [here](#merch). The brown and black belts are something special. They require you to complete activities normally in the Security Champion network.

## Merch

As SCN age, we will have different merch come and go. Below we have a record of some of the selections we have given out. Some of them are out of stock, some are in stock, you never know! Should we get someone to do inventory? Probably...

- Stickers: A large assortment of stickers to help show that you are the voice of security! With the number of stickers we have, you will get a proper workout while carrying your laptop.
- Hoodie: You act the part? Great! The only thing lacking is dressing for the part!
- Socks: Socks decorated with The Security Champion shields! Would they have protected Achilles? Maybe not. Will they protect you from cyber criminals? Who knows! But you will certainly look stylish while being hacked!
- Book (Alice and Bob Learn Application Security): Complete the challenge at [this form](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/cLRPzRtPGQ).
- AbbSack: You have to see it to believe it! Keep your items _secure_ while traveling.
- Lanyard: Decorate your neck with shields to ward off evil _phishing_ attacks. It even holds your card!
- Pins: Decorate your lanyard or clothes with shields to further increase your _phishing_ protection.
- Christmas ornament: No Christmas is secure without your own Security Champion Christmas tree ornament.
- S.W.A.T. (Small Work Addictive Thing), the latest and freshest within fidget toys. Meetings will never be the same!


To get these items, you can find out where the AppSec office is, social engineer your way into the building, find our seats, and ask for one or more of the items.

You can get in touch with the team when we do stands and events.

### Merch for belts

Since we are launching a new belt system connected to the secure coding platform, we need fresh merch! Below is a list of what you can get at the different belt systems. The items will be shipped via mail unless you can pick it up in the building (Forus Ã˜st). If shipped, it may take some time before you get it! But all things come to those who wait ;)

- White belt:
    - Your very own lanyard decorated with placeholders for those hard-earned pins.

    - A yellow pin to hang on your newly acquired lanyard. Be proud!
    - A yellow S.W.A.T. to showcase your advancement within security. It will be your best friend in meetings.

    - A black pin. Your final step to look like an overly decorated army general. You can retire happy as your life-long goal of contributing to Equinor's Security Champion Network is finally complete _for now_.
