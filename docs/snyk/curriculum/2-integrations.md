# Integrations

Integrations are merely ways to connect with Snyk. 

You can find all the supported integrations [here.](https://snyk.io/integrations/)

The most commonly used one is the [Github integration](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/snyk-github-integration#how-to-connect-github-to-snyk).
