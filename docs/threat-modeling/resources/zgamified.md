# Gamified Threat Modeling

This gamified method of doing threat modeling might not be for everyone, but it has its pros and is worth testing out.

## EOP Game-play

!!! success "Here are the pros:"
    \+ Depending on your level of geek: Fun!  
    \+ Predefined cards with suggested threats - no need to wreck your brain  
    \+ Encourages collaboration  
    \+ You end up with a JSON that can follow your code  
    \+ Remote!

!!! failure "..and the cons:"  
    \- Leads to many false positives  
    \- Time-consuming  (~2+ h)  
    \- Not everyone might find the game-aspect of it as intriguing  
    \- Requires a lot more effort than for example doing Agile Threat Modeling  
    \- Everyone needs a laptop  
    \- Requires 3-6 players

## Pre-reqs

- Its good to familiarize yourselves with the physical [EoP-cardgame](../threat-modeling-101-workshop/extention-EOP-cardgame.md)
- You need somewhere to host the EoP-game. A tried method is using a dedicated VM in Azure, and running a dockerized-instance of the game.
- Expect a few iteration to get everyone onboard with the game play
- Have a prize for the winner

!!! warning
    Regardless of how you deploy, be weary of what you information you are exposing through the diagram (IP-addresses, "Equinor", stuff like that

## How-to:

1. Spin up an instance of *[Elevation of Privilege](https://github.com/dehydr8/elevation-of-privilege)*, reachable to all participants
2. Download (or deploy) an instance of *[OWASP Threat Dragon](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon)*
3. Using OWASP Threat Dragon: Create a diagram of the system in scope
4. Upload the diagram to your EoP-instance, configure a session, distribute the links to participants

Depending on the system in scope, you can choose a suitable card-deck ([general](https://github.com/adamshostack/eop/blob/master/EoP_Card%20Game%20Images.pdf) vs. a [web application](https://owasp.org/www-project-cornucopia/assets/files/Owasp-cornucopia-ecommerce_website-EN.pdf))

Game-rules are described **[here](https://logmeincdn.azureedge.net/legal/gdpr-v2/eop-cards-ready-to-print.pdf)**

Afterwards, you can download the model with the added threats and keep it in your code repository.
