# Objectives and activities

## Background - (Why)

**Always safe** is one of three pillar in the Equinor strategy. Safety in the digital world includes cyber security. Equinor has many software development teams (internals and partners) and we expect a growth in DevOps teams in the future. Modern software development adopts all aspects of cloud capabilities and thus there is also an increased information security and privacy risk.

>The purpose of the AppSec team is to reduce cyber security risk in Equinor's SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle (DevOps teams).

The primary target audience for the team is Equinor's software development community - aka. DevOps teams.

## Main objectives - (How)

- Enable DevOps teams so they can reduce cyber security risks for software developed and operated by Equinor.
- Enable "shift-left" of security responsibility, meaning put developers in front, responsible for their application security. Striking the right balance between centralisation and teams responsibility is crucial.
- Competence building, strengthen the community of practice, provide hands-on help and tools for Equinor's DevOps teams.
- Focus on software development in general and primarily development for utilising cloud. (Cloud native principles and practices.)
- Work actively to create a good security culture for software development teams in Equinor.
- Work in close relationship with the IT Professional network. Leading Advisor for Security in Software Engineering is a key stakeholder and a member of the ISC AppSec team.

## Activities - (What)

- **Training/build competence** - Develop a curriculum covering "Secure Software Development / Applicaton Security" topics and provide training to Equinor's DevOps teams
- **Engage, train and offer threat modelling** for DevOps teams
- **Practical hands-on help** in Application Security/Secure Software Development - all aspects of the SDLC
- **Measurements** - Assessments of Application Security/Secure Software Development
- **Build a community** for Application Security, including security champions in Equinor DevOps teams
- **Perform security testing** - (tooling, automation, alignment with CSIRT/SOC)
- **Host and maintain a library** of "best practices" and examples
- **Explore options on how to secure our development supply chain** (e.g. Mandatory Equinor hubs and package repositories) - product owner for these solutions.
- **Operate tools related to secure software development** (e.g. Software Composition Analysis, Open Source Compliance, Static Code Analysis, Dynamic Code Analysis, Vulnerability scanning +++)
